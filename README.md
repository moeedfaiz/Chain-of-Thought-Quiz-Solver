üß† LangGraph-Powered Reasoning Assistant with RAG
This project is an interactive Reasoning and MCQ Assistant that leverages LangGraph, LangChain, and FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to process, decompose, and answer complex reasoning-style questions. It supports step-by-step logical reasoning, context retrieval, and even memory of past Q&A ‚Äî all served through a simple web interface built with Flask.

‚úÖ Key Features
LangGraph Integration: Uses a multi-node graph pipeline (decomposition ‚Üí retrieval ‚Üí answering) for modular and interpretable reasoning.

Document RAG: Loads MCQs with step-by-step solutions from a JSON file and creates a vector index using FAISS and HuggingFace embeddings.

LLM-Powered Decomposition: Questions are first broken down into smaller logical steps by an LLM using a specialized prompt.

Memory Recall: Remembers previous answers across sessions and can recall them when asked ("What was the previous answer?").

Flask Web UI: Offers a user-friendly web interface for asking questions, viewing answers, and tracking memory history.

Robust Error Handling: Built-in retry mechanism for API failures with exponential backoff.

üß© How It Works
User asks a question ‚Üí Sent to the LangGraph pipeline.

Decomposition Node ‚Üí Breaks down complex questions into logical steps using an LLM.

Retriever Node ‚Üí Fetches the most relevant context from the preloaded MCQs using FAISS and MiniLM embeddings.

Answer Node ‚Üí Uses another LLM prompt to answer the question step-by-step with context.

Memory System ‚Üí Stores Q&A pairs and recalls them when asked.
